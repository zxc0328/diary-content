## XSS & CSRF, Cookie & LocalStroge

### Types of XSS

+ Stored XSS (using form that will be stored in DB, input will be echoed back)
+ Reflected XSS (using URL query strings that will be echoed back)
+ DOM XSS (using URL query strings or hash that will be excuted by client side script)

>XSS is typically categorized into “non-persistent” and “persistent” ([3], “reflected” and “stored” accordingly, as defined in [4]). “Non-persistent” means that the malicious (Javascript) payload is echoed by the server in an immediate response to an HTTP request from the victim. “Persistent” means that the payload is stored by the system, and may later be embedded by the vulnerable system in an HTML page provided to a victim.
