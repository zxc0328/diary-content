## Notes on YDKJS:Types & Grammar part 1

### Types

#### `typeof()`
 
 ````
 typeof(null) // "object"
 typeof(function(){}) // "function"
 ````

### Values

#### Array

Using `delete` on `array` value won't update the `length` value. And string keys won't count toward the `length`. But a string of number is assumed as number index rather than as string key.

So, don't use `delete` and don't use "sparse" array.

As for array-likes, see [previous diary](http://zxc0328.github.io/diary/2016/03/2016-03-24.html).

#### String

`strings` in JavaScript are immutable. We can use nonmutation `array` methods with `strings`. Like `map()` and `join`.

The workaround here to use mutable `array` methods with `strings` is to convert the `string` into an `array`, do the magic and convert it back.

It's better to use `array` to store characters than using `string` if you want to use `array` badly.

#### Number

**Internals**

IEEE754 Double-precision floating-point format

**Base Presetation**

+ Binary: 0B/0b  
+ Octal: 0O/0o  
+ Hexadecimal: 0X/0x  

**Small Decimal Values**

`0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3; // false`
 
This fails because the floating-point format JS use for numbers.
The most commonly accepted practice is to use a **tiny "rounding error"** value as the tolerance for comparison. It is called "machine epsilon," `2^-52 (2.220446049250313e-16)`.

````
function numbersCloseEnoughToEqual(n1,n2){
	return Math.abs( n1 - n2 ) < Number.EPSILON
}
````

**`isInteger()`polyfill**

```
if (!Number.isInteger) {
    Number.isInteger = function(num) {
        return typeof num == "number" && num % 1 == 0;
    };
}
```

**Undefined**

`Null` is an identifier in JS while `undefined` is not.
 
**Friends don't let friends override `undefined`. Ever.**
