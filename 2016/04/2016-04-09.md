## Lambda Calculus

Lambda calculus (also written as λ-calculus or called “the lambda calculus”) is a formal system in mathematical logic and computer science for expressing computation by way of variable binding and substitution. First formulated by Alonzo Church.

### Syntax

An expression in lambda calculus can be a:

+ variable: `x`  
+ lambda abstraction (function): `λx.x`  
(where . separates the function argument and body)  
+ function application: `x y`  

### Church Numerals

Alonzo Church came up with such an encoding, where the value of a numeral is equivalent to the number of times a function is applied to an argument. This can be written as `λs.λz. s^n z`, where n is the natural number represented and `s^n` means function `s` composed with itself `n` times (we’ll say “applied `n` times” for short).

Thus the first few natural numbers are encoded as follows:

+ `0 = λs.λz. z` the function `s` is applied to the argument `z` zero times
+ `1 = λs.λz. s z` the function `s` is applied once
+ `2 = λs.λz. s (s z)` the function `s` is applied twice

Lets also quickly look at how we can write simple functions with numbers.

```
successor  = λn.λs.λz. s (n s z) (n + 1)
```
```
add = λa.λb.λs.λz. a s (b s z) (a + b)
```
```
mul = λa.λb.λs. a b s (a * b)
```
