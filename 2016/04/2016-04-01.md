### Optimizations in lo-dash

We should try not to obsess over micro optimizations, but looking for an established common case and making sure that common case is fast and that the external or overloaded functionality comes second. 

For example, you don't need to worry about array push versus assigning it directly to the array. 

The things that have become significant are things like avoiding **linear** look ups for uniquing and differencing and intersecting array, or introducing **lazy evaluation** and **shortcut fusion** to reduce tons and tons of iteration in it. And those are the kinds of things that win performance.

### Built-in is alway faster?

Not exactly. In fact, native functions often have to cover complicated edge cases from the ECMAScript specification, which put them at a performance disadvantage.

And built-ins are not magic that avoid doing any work, they are normal code implemented by humans. User code is actually optimized and compiled into native code.

So in some cases user implementation is faster than built-ins.
