## Side Effect && Immutable 

### Side Effects

 What's a side effect?  A piece of code whereby a variable is created and available throughout a scope when it doesn't need to be.  Let me show you a few examples and how to avoid these unwanted side effects.
 

### Immutable Data Structure

Immutable data **cannot** be changed once created, leading to much simpler application development, no defensive copying, and enabling advanced memoization and change detection techniques with simple logic. 

### Persistent Data Structure

Persistent data presents a mutative API which does not update the data in-place, but instead always yields new updated data.

In Redux, we only mutate the part of the store that has changed. And keep the previous store's refrence. Thus preventing the CPU and memory costs for copying object every time.
