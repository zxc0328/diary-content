## Levenshtein distance && MVVM list diff

### the Levenshtein distance way

Levenshtein distance is a dynamic programming approach algorithm to diff two strings. The output is the needed insertion, deletion, and substitution of character for the second string to be sync with the first one.

### the Vue way

Levenshtein distance can be used to diff two arrays. So some MVVM framework will use this algorithm to diff the old data array and the new data array. But the Vue way is different. It reallocate a new array, and put those vms who is not being modified in it, for new vms, it creates new vm and push it into the array. Fianlly, it make the DOM
 and the data array sync.
