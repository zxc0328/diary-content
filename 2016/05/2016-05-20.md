## After thought of watching JavaScript Air Episode 006: Introducing the JavaScript Air Panel

In this episode we got every panelist in JavaScript Air. So it's basically chatting things about themselves.

So here are some points:

+ Health is important
+ Find a hobby besides programming
+ Pair programming is great
+ Workshops in US is a big deal, so are those companies which teach programming
+ The best way to learn is to write code 

That's all. I'll go read so Medium stuff and go to bed now.
