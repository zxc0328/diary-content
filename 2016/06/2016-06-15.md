## V8 bailout reasons && more V8 resources

### How to detect bailouts in your code

```
// Install V8
brew install V8 
// Run V8 in CLI with flags
d8 --trace-opt --allow-natives-syntax demo.js

// Output. If there is a bailout, you can see the reason.
[disabled optimization for 0x36398bdcce9 <SharedFunctionInfo foo>,
 reason: Unsupported phi use of arguments]
```

You can find some examples, explanations and advices on V8 bailout with [V8 bailout reasons](https://github.com/vhf/v8-bailout-reasons).

And this [Optimization killers](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/wiki/Optimization-killers) doc is helpful too.

### [IRHydra2](http://mrale.ph/irhydra/2/)

A tool that helps you to visualize the output of V8 when bailout happens.

````
d8 --trace-hydrogen --trace-phase=Z --trace-deopt --code-comments  --hydrogen-track-positions  --redirect-code-traces --redirect-code-traces-to=code.asm demo.js
````
And open code.asm and hydrogen.cfg in IRHydra2.

P.S. You gotta to be sure that the js code will be optimized(the function is hot), and will cause bailout due to some reasons.

P.P.S I tried sereval times but my js file just didn't cause deoptimiztion. So good luck.
