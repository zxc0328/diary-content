### Style Guide

+ [Airbnb CSS / Sass Styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/css)
+ [Sass Style Guide by Chris Coyier](https://css-tricks.com/sass-style-guide/)
+ [Sass lint rules doc](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint/tree/develop/docs/rules)

So I pulled a style guide out and named it [Muxi CSS Style Guide](https://github.com/Muxi-Studio/muxife-conf/blob/master/cssconf/README.md)
