## Semantics of `<i>`,`<b>`,`<em>`&`<strong>`

The `<i>` tag and `<em>` tag in HTML have the same style -- *italic*, but they actually have different semantics. So do `<b>` and `<strong>`.

### `<i>`

`<i>` tag represents text that is set off from the normal prose, such as the name of a movie or book, a foreign word, or when the text refers to the definition of a word instead of representing its semantic meaning.

An example for `<i>` could be: "The *Queen Mary* sailed last night". 

### `<em>`

The `<em>`tag represents stress emphasis of its contents.

An example for `<em>` could be: "Just *do* it already!", or: "We *had* to do something about it". A person or software reading the text would pronounce the words in italics with an emphasis.

### `<b>`

The HTML `<b>` Element represents a span of text stylistically different from normal text, without conveying any special importance or relevance.

### `<strong>`

Use the `<strong>` element to mark text that has **greater importance** than surrounding text.

### Summary

So `<b>` not have any special semantics, while `<strong>` emphasis more than `<em>`. And `<i>` tag represents text that is set off from the normal prose.
