## Call & Apply's Performance Issue

I was looking for some real world example of Pub/Sub pattern in Backbone's event system when I came across something like this:

```
var triggerEvents = function(events, args) {
    var ev, i = -1, l = events.length, a1 = args[0], a2 = args[1], a3 = args[2];
    switch (args.length) {
      case 0: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.call(ev.ctx); return;
      case 1: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.call(ev.ctx, a1); return;
      case 2: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.call(ev.ctx, a1, a2); return;
      case 3: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.call(ev.ctx, a1, a2, a3); return;
      default: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.apply(ev.ctx, args); return;
    }
  };
```

And the annotation beside this is 

> A difficult-to-believe, but optimized internal dispatch function for triggering events. Tries to keep the usual cases speedy (most internal Backbone events have 3 arguments).


### Call & Apply's Performance:Benchmark

I found [some benchmark](https://jsperf.com/test-call-vs-apply/12) on JSPerf. And it returns out there is only some subtle difference in results. 

The benchmark only test the case when there is only one paramater. So the difference maybe more distinct when there is more paramaters.

### Call & Apply's Performance:Insight through ECMA spec

The definition on ECMA 5.1 about call and apply only has some subtle difference. Apply takes array-like object as second paramater so it has an extra step of looping the object and pushing them into the arguments list inside the function.

So it's pretty fair to say that call will be even faster when there is more paramaters. We'll do some test to prove that in the near future.

### Todo

+ Make a test when there are 10 paramaters or more
