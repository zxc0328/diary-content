## Vue community diary: avoid VNode in data (#6610)&& deep clone slot vnodes on re-render(#6372)

### Issue

#### Avoid VNode in data

Passing vnode as data will make the prop for vnode reactive, and the render function may be its dependency. In vue 2.4.3, slot nodes are now deep-cloned on re-render.

So when vnode is mutated, an infinite re-render will be called.

#### deep clone slot vnodes on re-render

Using deep clone when re-render slot vnodes due to slot vnodes **could have nested component**.


### Thought

The fix for #6610 is `Avoid VNode in data`. This is straghtforward.

`#6372`: the content of the slot **will be re-created** if the element wrapping the slots are changed.

> This is fixed, but do note that because you are changing the element wrapping the slots, the element is considered "replaced" and thus all slot content, including the components in it, will be destroyed and then re-created. This is unfortunately how the vdom patching works and unlikely to change.
