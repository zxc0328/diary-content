## Vue community diary: a tricky edge case with vdom event(#6566)

### Issue

[@click would trigger event other vnode @click event. #6566](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/6566)

### Thought

```
<div class="header" v-if="expand"> // block 1
  <i @click="expand = false, countA++">Expand is True</i> // element 1
</div>
<div class="expand" v-if="!expand" @click="expand = true, countB++"> // block 2
  <i>Expand is False</i> // element 2
</div>
```

This is a tricky edge case, when the `<i>` triggers event, the `expand = false` triggers a update, which is scheduled as a microtask. The point here is **The microtask is processed before the event bubbles to the outer div.** So when the update is finished, the dom is updated. Because `expand` is now `false`, so the `div` below is rendered, and this `div` has a click event listener. 

So the event should bubble to the old `div` above, but that `div` is destoryed. So everything should work fine. Well, it's not the case because Vue's vdom will reuse dom node that has the same structure as the old one.

The result here is **the event will bubble to the `div` below, which is unexpected.**

> This is quite tricky in fix, and other libs that leverages microtask for update queueing also have this problem (e.g. Preact). React doesn't seem to have this problem because they use a synthetic event system (probably due to edge cases like this).


**The issue is due to vdom reuse mechanism and microtask internals.** The fact that microtask is processed before the event bubbles is important to note.

### Future

Seems won't be fixed soon.
